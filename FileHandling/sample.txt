Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. Unlike traditional JavaScript, which runs in the browser, Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript on the server, making it an essential part of building scalable and high-performance web applications.

Key features of Node.js include:

1. **Event-driven and Non-blocking I/O:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient, particularly for applications that involve a lot of I/O operations like reading from files, interacting with databases, or handling network requests.

2. **Single-threaded:** While Node.js operates on a single thread, it uses an event loop to handle multiple requests concurrently, which allows it to efficiently manage tasks that involve waiting for I/O operations to complete.

3. **Built on Chrome's V8 Engine:** Node.js is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript directly to machine code for fast execution.

4. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that allows developers to install, share, and manage libraries and tools. NPM has a vast repository of open-source packages for everything from web frameworks to utility libraries.

5. **Asynchronous Programming:** Node.js supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed without waiting for previous tasks to complete. This is especially useful for building highly responsive and scalable web applications.

Node.js is commonly used for building server-side applications like APIs, real-time chat apps, and even entire web applications, and it's often paired with front-end technologies like React.js or Angular for full-stack development.
